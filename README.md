# RDBMS-Design-Implementation
Scenario: I am a Data Engineer of a coffee shop chain that is looking to expand nationally by opening a number of franchise locations. As part of their expansion process, they want to streamline operations and revamp their data infrastructure. My job is to design their relational database systems for improved operational efficiencies and to make it easier for their executives to make data driven decisions.
